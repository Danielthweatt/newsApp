# Deadspin Scraper
This is my first full stack app utilizing mongoose. 
It is a Deadspin scraper.
## How to Use 
When the page is loaded, all articles on the Deadspin 
homepage will be scraped, saved to the database, and 
displayed on the page. You can click on each article 
to follow the link to it, or click on its comment 
button to see previous comments, add a comment, or 
delete a comment. In the navbar are buttons that will 
re-scrape Deadspin, display all previously scraped 
articles, and display all articles with comments.
